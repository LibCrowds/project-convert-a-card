<p>
    The purpose of this project is to link scanned images, such as the one below,
    to catalogue records held in an external database.
</p>
<div class="row text-center">
    <img src="/static/img/tutorials/card.jpg" width="200" class="img-thumbnail"
         alt="Chinese_PY_Titles_A-By1204" alt="Catalogue card" />
</div>
<br />
<p>
    Your tasks comes in two parts:
    <ol>
        <li>Locate the catalogue record relating to the card displayed.</li>
        <li>Transcribe the shelf mark shown on the card.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>
    Next to the image of the card you will be provided with a set of search fields for the title,
    author, publication year and ISBN of the item. Once you have performed a search and retrieved
    some results, you can choose the appropriate record by clicking on the select button to the
    right of that record.
</p>
<p>
    If you are unable to locate the correct record, please click the 'Skip / Not found' button.
</p>
<div class="row text-center">
   <img src="/static/img/tutorials/card_buttons.png" width="200" class="img-thumbnail"
        alt="Chinese_PY_Titles_A-By1204">
</div>
<br />

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>
    If you managed to locate a matching record, the next stage is to transcribe the shelf mark,
    which is usually located at the top right of the image. Very occasionally the shelf mark
    will be in a different location but after you have completed a few tasks you should be
    able to recognise these shelf marks more easily.
</p>
<p>
    Please try to transcribe the shelf mark as accurately as possible, including maintaining the
    case and punctuation.
</p>
<p>
    That's it! Once you have have finished click 'Done' and you will be presented with the next task.
